The outbreak ended following extremely cold temperatures during the winter of 1993-1994 that killed most of the beetles in infested trees. In the winter, very cold temperatures can kill trees outright, or periods when the soil is frozen followed by sudden warming trends can severely stress or kill trees. Tree roses are particularly sensitive to cold winter temperatures. The original tree was killed by cold in the winter of 1895-96. In such cases, the sapwood in the trunks and branches of affected trees and shrubs was injured or killed due to cold winter temperatures. A long winter with steady cold temperatures, and a cool, wet spring delayed orchard work and planting of new trees. If temperatures drop too low during the winter, entire trees of some species are killed by the freezing and splitting of plant cells and tissue.

Water moves from clouds to land and back to the ocean in a never ending cycle. the water cycle (ocean to clouds to rivers to ocean); Hydrologic Cycle - Continual natural cycle through which water moves from oceans to clouds to ground and ultimately back to the oceans. It involves setting up seven stations that are all a part of the water cycle--cloud, mountain, ocean, stream, groundwater, animal, and plant. The cycle begins with water evaporating from oceans and forming clouds that move over the continents. Water continuously moves through a global cycle, evaporating from lakes and oceans, forming clouds, precipitating as rain or snow, and flowing back to the oceans. Focus is on the role of circulation, clouds, radiation, water vapor, and precipitation in climate change, and the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in energy and water cycles.

This has to do with the fact that at every step in the food chain only 10 percent of the available energy gets passed on (starting with the energy of the sun incident on the plants). They can convert about ten percent of the producer food into consumer life energy. Once used, energy is unavailable for reuse Food chain follows flow of energy in ecosystem Sun = Producer = primary consumer = secondary consumer = tertiary consumer = decomposer Producers trap energy in photosynthesis (plants) Herbivores eat plants, as do omnivores getting chemical energy and building blocks for other molecules Carnivores and omnivores eat the herbivores, getting energy from herbivore molecules Decomposers break down organic molecules in remains at all levels Food web is more accurate, because there are range of food sources and complex, interconnected chains Trophic level is each level in a food web First is primary producers Second trophic level is primary consumers, etc. Energy moves from one trophic level to next as long as it isn t used for biological work Pyramid of numbers shows number of organisms at each trophic level. Energy source for life is the sun, transferred by plants to us as food. Shows how each food chain begins with plants (producers) and the chain of energy transfers to animals(consumers). Food Chain A natural transfer of food energy from producers (green plants) to successive consumers (herbivores and carnivores); A basic approximation of the energy that is transferred through each step in a food chain is that only 10% of the energy consumed at one level is passed to the next. Organic plant life consumes energy from the sun. Food chain The transfer of food energy from producers through a series of consumers. Like the plant, the animal uses most of the energy it consumes for functions such as growth and sustenance but can offer about 10 percent of the energy it derived from plants to the next consumer in the food chain.

Trees in the tropical rain forests make up 70 percent of the plant species and can grow up to 200 feet tall. from tall forest trees and small trees and to large and small shrubs, to make full use of the space available and to grow plants in the conditions they would naturally inhabit. Tropical Rain Forest One of the most beautiful areas of SeaWorld features 30-foot tall bamboo trees, exotic banyan trees, and many other plants and trees commonly found in tropical rain forests. Woody vines grow in rain forest, and a large number of plants of the type called epiphytes live among the tall trees. The complex plant adaptations to tropical rain forest conditions are represented. THE RAIN FOREST THE RAIN FOREST The characteristic structure of the rain forest is many ""layers"" or levels of growth: starting with the tallest trees emerging from the canopy, many levels of shorter trees below that, tall shrubs, short shrubs, vines that grow up into the canopy, epiphytes (plants that grow on other plants, usually trees, which are not parasitic to the tree, but simply use it to ""perch"" on it) abound at every level, and lastly, small ferns and herbaceous (non-woody) plants at the ground level.

The effect is somewhat like hand rubbing the skin to produce a warming effect, but this occurs deep in the tissue.

DO NOT warm the victim by rubbing his or her skin or by applying direct heat. If you want to remove the loose skins from a few pounds quickly, rub them between your hands or in a towel.

The space suit provides protection to the astronaut from micrometeoroids. These reflective layers are protected from environmental hazards by protective outer surface layers. Space suits used by shuttle astronauts include 11 layers of material. There is emphasis on how a space suit can protect astronauts from the space environment. America's first astronauts come to BFGoodrich for the suits that will protect them in outer space. America's first astronauts"
